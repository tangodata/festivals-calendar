The whole purpose of Tango is to allow two people to 
hold each other and enjoy a dance together.   
This is a beautiful thing when it happens.

For many people, the community they live in provides 
a small pool of potential dance partners.  
Frequently dancers wish to dance with new people, to grow, 
or to challenge themselves.

Hence the need to travel to various Tango Festivals,
Marathons, Encuentros, Workshops, Dance Camps, etc.

## Where Can We Find Up-to-Date Calendars

Here are some popular, well-maintained data sources:

- tango.info
- tangofestivals.net
- tangomarathons.org
- facebook
- festivalsero.org

Because details of festivals are being announced constantly,
it is a major effort to try to keep a current list.  
Frequently the information that has been collected becomes
out-of-date.

## The Tangodata Project

With the Tangodata Project, we turn the collection of festival
data over to the organisers in a crowd-sourced, open source
collaboration.

The repository contains source documents for all the major tango
countries and cities.  The format is YAML which is  a simple
text file with indentation.

Anyone can fork the repository and add extra information to the sources.

Once a month, the current list will be reconstructed from the source
data, and turned into a variety of formats: HTML, CSV, JSON.

Permission is granted to allow any application developer to download and
use the data to populate their application.
