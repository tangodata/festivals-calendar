    Description: "An encuentro milonguero in the San Francisco Bay Area, June 17 to June 19, 2016. While some private events in USA call themselves 'encuentro milonguero', this one is open to all. All styles of social Tango are welcome in SFM2016, be it 'milonguero' or 'estilo de barrio'. Adherence to the floor, or navigational, códigos is what counts. We encourage to follow also the social códigos of the milonga, but this is a personal choice. The San Francisco Bay Area is a great place to come and visit, and dance social Tango!!. There is also an optional tour of the San Francisco Bay Area. \n- Opening milonga with Seth Asarnow y su Sexteto Típico, playing Golden Era favorites in the style of the Golden Era great orchestras.\n- 5 workshops with Maestra Susana Miller.\n- Leader/follower balanced.\n- 5 milongas with great DJs playing time-tested tunes from the Golden Era of Tango."

At this encuentro we welcome all forms of social dancing, not just Milonguero/Downtown/Club/Apilado dancing. The also popular ''estilo del barrio'', a.k.a. Villa Urquiza, is also welcome.'
