It is expected the data is rebuilt once a month, and contains valid information
for the next 12 months on rolling basis.

The structure of the projects:

## inputs

- input data is stored in YML format
- one file per region/country/city (depending on volume)
- core information in English

## processors

- build stage combines all the raw YML files
- old/expired entries go to Archive, new/future entries go to Current

## outputs

- equivalent files in JSON, Comma-delimited text
